## LTRACN (Long-Term Recurrent Attention Convolutional Network)
<br> 
Dataset: For training and evaluation of our model we have used HMDB-51: A large video database for human motion recognition by H. Kuehne, H. Jhuang, E. Garrote, T. Poggio & T. Serre, 2011. The dataset consists of a massive collection of realistic videos gathered from various sources like YouTube, movies etc. It consists of 51 categories/classes like jump, laugh, punch, hug etc. where each class has atleast 101 video clips. In contains a total of 6,849 video clips.
